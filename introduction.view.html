    <h2 class="text-secondary my-3 text-3xl">Dependencies</h2>
    <p class="py-4">
        You can account for nested dependencies by creating a static function "dependencies" on the PHP-controller.
        No need to import your dependencies or taking care of nested dependencies. There are two scenarios you want to account for:

    </p>
    <h3 class="text-secondary my-2 text-xl">Reusability</h3>
    <p class="py-4">
        Created a new component and used another component? Add the dependency to the composer.json of the component (using neoan3 publish).
        This way, whenever that component is used in another project, dependencies are installed along with it.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-secondary my-2 text-xl">Inheritance</h3>
    <p class="py-4">
        What makes vast-n3 so fast is the neoan3-core. In order to only load needed components,
        vast-n3's functions "vueComponent" & "vueComponents" look for a function "dependencies" which should return an array of component names.
        As an example you might want to look into the register component which requires "animation" and "modal".
        This means that whenever a neoan3 route uses "register", the components "animation" and "modal" are automatically imported.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-secondary my-3 text-3xl">Best practices</h2>
    <p class="py-4">
        vast-n3 uses neoan3's methodology for development, collaboration and versioning.
        As such, make use of neoan3's publish logic and treat every component as it's own git repository.
        vast-n3 comes to you as a complete installer. But just like every other neoan3 project,
        you can add or update single components. <br>
        <code>neoan3 add component login https://vast-n3/component-login.git</code> <br>
        will install vast-n3's login component including its dependencies into any neoan3-project.
        However, be aware that we have opted <span class="font-bold">not</span> to use neoan3's singleton approach.
        This means that our components do require the vast-n3 frame as a hard-coded necessity. <br><br>
        The recommended way to take complete control over your project is to change the
        upstream of the component you are working on and pointing it to a fork you made.
